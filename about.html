                                A reoccuring holiday tradition for Centennial's Musician's With A Purpose (MWAP) club is to practice for, and then perform holiday carols for those at Plano's Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who can't spend the ordinarily festive time in the comfort of thier own homes. This initiate brings some joy and holiday spirit to those who are in an otherwise stressful point in their lives. <br /><br />
                                I look forward to acting as the secretary for the group in the holiday season of 2020.</p>

                            <p>In 2002, I was born with a congenital condition called symbrachydactyly. Because of this my left arm is significatly smaller the the average person's, as it stopped forming shortly after elbow joint.</p>

After high school graduation, I will meet the age requirements in order to volunteer as a camp counselor and look forward to giving back to the organization and being to a new generation of kids what my counselors were to me, someone they can depend on and look up to.
